General Homework Guidelines:
- Homework must be submitted in a .py file. Please do not submit .ipynb files.
- Use comments to explain what your code is doing.
- Use a consistent coding style.
- Use descriptive variable names.
- Test your code regularly using a variety of different inputs.
- Every function must include a DocString for documentation (see:
   https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/). This DocString should include:
     - 1 or 2 lines describing what the function does
     - input parameters, their types and what they are for
     - return data type and what it is
- All tests of your functions should be commented out in your final submission or 
	enclosed with an if __name__ == '__main__' code block.
- All functions should use return statements to return a value, rather than printing 
	some value, unless the instructions specifically say to print.
