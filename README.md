Data Visualization

### Course Overview
This course explores visualization techniques and theory. The course covers how to use
visualization tools to effectively present data as part of quantitative statements within a
publication/report and as an interactive system. Both design principles (color, layout, scale, and
psychology of vision) as well as technical visualization tools/languages will be covered.

### Objectives
Students will understand and be able to apply visualization techniques for both exploratory data
analysis and formal reporting. Students will write Python scripts controlling packages: numpy,
pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotnine, and plotly.
